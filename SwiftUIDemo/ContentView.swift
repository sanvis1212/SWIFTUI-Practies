     1- Binding state means modify the value of property of struct by using *@State* property wrapper and bind with property wrapper . Example - Suppose you are creating textFiled and keep changing the value of textfiled it's also keep on changing  the struct property . It is called two way binding and achinving by using *$* symbol.

 // Modify the program state
 
 1 - In UIKit - You can change it by creating IBAction of button where as If talk about SwiftUI Its give you call back to get action of button
 2- There is one more intresting thing about the struct -
    as we all know about if you want to modify strut property value than we have to use * mutating func *  where as Fortunately, Swift gives us a special solution called a property wrapper:
    we can place *@State*  before our properties . we can use a property wrapper from SwiftUI called @State .
 
 //Bind state to user interface
